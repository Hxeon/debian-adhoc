# debian-adhoc
Scripts to turn Debian computers into an Ad-Hoc network.

I just felt like doing this tonight. I know Windows computers can be put in Ad-Hoc mode, but now I want to make it easier for myself (and others) to do the same on Linux, without needing to deal with the terminal or anything like that. I cater to particular users who may not know how to deal with stuff like that. So I come up with very user-friendly solutions that I usually end up implementing anyways. So this makes it easier for everyone altogether.https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/
